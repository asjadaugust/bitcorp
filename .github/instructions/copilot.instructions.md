Copilot Instructions ‚Äì Bitcorp ERP: Civil Works Equipment Management Platform

üß≠ Purpose

These instructions provide GitHub Copilot with guidance on how to assist in developing Bitcorp ERP, a modern civil engineering equipment and operator management system. The application will serve planning engineers, cost engineers, HR, and field operators with both web and mobile interfaces.

Additionally, Copilot should generate in-depth explanations for each implementation it suggests, suitable for a junior developer preparing for interviews. These should include:
	‚Ä¢	Why a specific library or pattern is used
	‚Ä¢	Architectural decisions
	‚Ä¢	Performance and scalability trade-offs
	‚Ä¢	Security and testing implications
	‚Ä¢	Related software engineering principles (SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Short Q&A to reinforce learning
	‚Ä¢	Reference to relevant books in the `/books` folder
	‚Ä¢	Deployment considerations for Synology NAS
	‚Ä¢	How to write clean, maintainable code


	I am also reading the books in the list below to prepare for interviews, pdf in the `/books` folder:
		‚Ä¢	"Clean code in Python" by Mariano Anaya
		‚Ä¢	"Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann
		‚Ä¢	"Elements of Programming Interviews" by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash
		‚Ä¢	"Object-Oriented Basics - Grokking the object oriented design interview"
		‚Ä¢	"Building Large Scale Web Apps. A React Field Guide" by Osmani A.
		‚Ä¢	"Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" by Martin Fowler
		‚Ä¢	"React Interview Guide" by Sudheer Jonna, Andrew Baisden
		‚Ä¢	"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler
		‚Ä¢	"SQL Antipatterns" by Bill Karwin
		‚Ä¢	"Refactoring UI: The Book" by Adam Wathan, Steve Schoger
		‚Ä¢	"Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin
		‚Ä¢	"Clean Coder - A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers" by Robert C. Martin
		‚Ä¢	"API Design Patterns" by JJ Geewax
		‚Ä¢	"Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" by Eric Evans
		‚Ä¢	"Pure React" by Dave Ceddia
		‚Ä¢	"React Design Patterns and Best Practices" by Michele Bertoli
	So, Copilot should also reference these books where relevant to reinforce concepts.
		

Deployment Context:

The entire codebase will be deployed on a Synology NAS. Ensure all Docker, volume, and runtime scripts are compatible with a Synology Docker environment. Include documentation and compatibility advice specific to Synology‚Äôs DSM.

üí° Important Notes:
 - Consider checking the following folders for inspiration:
		‚Ä¢	`/old_code/`
		‚Ä¢	`/books/`
		‚Ä¢	`/docs/`
 - Don't update the `/docs/` or the `/old_code/` folder, it is for reference only.
 - Add notes and references to the `/docs/` folder, not the `/old_code/` folder.
 - Reference the `/books/` folder for relevant books and resources.
 - Check the prd.instructions.md file for the latest project requirements and updates.
 - Build the application incrementally, starting with the core features and expanding to advanced functionalities.
 - Document each step thoroughly, including code explanations, architectural decisions, and performance considerations and add them to the `/docs/` folder.
 - Use the `/docs/` folder to provide detailed explanations, learning prompts, and interview preparation
 - Ensure all code is compatible with Synology NAS Docker environment, including deployment scripts and configurations.
 - Every feature implemented should include detailed commentary and learning prompts to support the user‚Äôs growth as a full stack engineer.
 - Add the relevant code and commit and push it to the repository.
 - Use conventional commit messages for all changes, following the format: `feat: <description>`, `fix: <description>`, `docs: <description>`, etc. Keep the commit messages concise and descriptive.
 - Use the Bitcorp.sql file within the db folder to generate the initial database schema and add dummy data for the Bitcorp ERP civil works platform.
 - Keep in mind that I only speak English, so all comments, documentation, and code should be in English. However, you can use Spanish for the database schema and dummy data if needed, as it is a common language in the civil works industry. Also, the application is targeted for a Spanish-speaking audience, so the frontend should support both English and Spanish localization.
 - I would appreciate it if you could provide detailed explanations for each implementation, including the reasoning behind design choices, performance considerations, and security implications. This will help me understand the code better and prepare for interviews.
 - Also, create a new branch for each feature or bug fix, following the naming convention `feature/<description>` or `bugfix/<description>`. This will help keep the main branch clean and organized. Also, add some nice PR descriptions for each PR, summarizing the changes made, the reasoning behind them, and any relevant links or references.
 - Update the Readme.md file in the root directory with a summary of the project, installation instructions, and usage examples. This will help new developers get started quickly and understand the project structure.
 - Before pushing the code, ensure the builds are passing and all tests are successful. Use GitHub Actions to automate the testing and deployment process, ensuring that the code is always in a deployable state.
 - Maintain a changelog file in the root directory to track changes, features, and bug fixes. This will help keep the project organized and make it easier to understand the evolution of the codebase.
 - I am using copilot to help me with the development, so please ensure that all code is well-structured, modular, and follows best practices. This will make it easier for me to understand and learn.
 - Give me references and resources to learn from as I go along, including links to relevant documentation, tutorials, and articles. This will help me deepen my understanding of the technologies used in the project.
 - Feel free to quiz me on the concepts and technologies used in the project, as this will help reinforce my learning and prepare me for interviews.
 - Make sure to document any known issues, limitations, or areas for improvement in the project along with decisions made, their reasons and any alternatives worth looking into. This will help me understand the current state of the codebase and identify areas that need attention.


Copilot: Use this file to generate consistent backend logic, clean frontend components, test coverage, and deployment automation for the Bitcorp ERP civil works platform. Additionally, provide detailed commentary and learning prompts throughout to support the user‚Äôs growth as a full stack engineer preparing for interviews. All deployment guidance must account for compatibility with Synology NAS Docker environment.
