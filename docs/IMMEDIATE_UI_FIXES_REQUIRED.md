# üö® Immediate UI/UX Fixes Required - Implementation Plan

## üìã **Critical Issues Identified**

Based on user feedback, the following foundational issues need immediate attention before proceeding with the strategic development phases:

### **1. Authentication Flicker Issue**
- **Problem**: Refreshing or navigating between pages briefly shows login page as a flicker
- **Root Cause**: Authentication state loading/checking delays
- **Priority**: HIGH - affects user experience across entire application

### **2. Navigation Back Button Missing**
- **Problem**: No way to go back from Equipment page
- **Current State**: Back button exists but may not be prominent enough
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - affects navigation flow

### **3. Add Equipment Form Not Working**
- **Problem**: Using Add Equipment page shows nothing
- **Root Cause**: Form routing or modal implementation issue
- **Priority**: HIGH - core functionality broken

### **4. Empty Database State**
- **Problem**: No dummy data to see on the equipment page, currently no rows
- **Root Cause**: Missing seed data for development/demo
- **Priority**: HIGH - prevents proper testing and demonstration

-- Include realistic equipment entries for testing
-- Populate different equipment types and statuses
```

#### **Fix 4: Navigation Enhancement**
```typescript
// Improve breadcrumb navigation
// Add clear "Back to Dashboard" functionality
// Implement consistent navigation patterns
```

### **Phase 2: UI/UX Polish (This Week)**
