The `/books/` directory contains industry-leading technical resources that form the educational backbone of the Bitcorp ERP development journey. This guide provides a structured approach to integrating these resources with practical implementation, ensuring every development phase is supported by proven methodologies and best practices.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Integration Strategy

### Educational Philosophy

Our approach combines **theoretical understanding** with **practical application**, using each book as a foundation for implementing real-world features in the Bitcorp ERP system. Rather than passive reading, we actively apply concepts immediately in our codebase, creating a hands-on learning experience that builds both knowledge and practical skills.
