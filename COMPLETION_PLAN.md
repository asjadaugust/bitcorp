## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### License Management Architecture
```typescript
interface LicenseToken {
  userId: string;
  tokenBalance: number;
  subscriptionTier: 'free' | 'starter' | 'professional' | 'enterprise';
  expiresAt: Date;
  features: string[];
}

// Middleware for token-gated endpoints
async function requireTokens(tokensRequired: number) {
  // Verify license, check balance, deduct tokens
}

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- User licensing table
CREATE TABLE user_licenses (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,

  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Token usage history
CREATE TABLE token_usage (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  feature_name VARCHAR(100),
  tokens_consumed INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
