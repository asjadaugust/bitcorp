GET    /api/v1/scheduling/schedules/           # List schedules (with filters)
GET    /api/v1/scheduling/schedules/{id}       # Get specific schedule
DELETE /api/v1/scheduling/schedules/{id}       # Delete schedule
```

### **Conflict Detection & Availability**
```
POST   /api/v1/scheduling/schedules/check-conflict     # Check for conflicts
GET    /api/v1/scheduling/schedules/conflicts          # List all conflicts
GET    /api/v1/scheduling/equipment/{id}/availability  # Check availability
GET    /api/v1/scheduling/equipment/{id}/schedules     # Equipment schedules
```

### **Analytics & Intelligence**
```
GET    /api/v1/scheduling/statistics                    # Overall statistics
