# Phase 1 Feature 1 Implementation: Equipment Scheduling System

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Implementation
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

Successfully created and deployed:

#### **Core Tables**
- `equipment_schedules` - Main scheduling table with conflict detection constraints
- `projects` - Project management table for schedule associations  
- `schedule_conflicts_log` - Audit trail for conflict resolutions

#### **Database Functions**
- `check_schedule_conflicts()` - Advanced conflict detection with severity levels
- `get_equipment_availability()` - Time slot calculation for equipment availability
- `update_equipment_status_from_schedule()` - Automatic status updates via triggers

#### **Views and Indexes**
- `equipment_availability` - Real-time availability view
- Performance indexes on equipment_id, dates, and status
- Trigger system for automatic equipment status updates

#### **Sample Data**
- 3 sample projects (Highway 101 Expansion, Downtown Bridge Repair, Industrial Park Access Road)
- 3 sample equipment schedules testing the system
- Foreign key relationships verified and working

#### **Testing Results**
- ‚úÖ Equipment availability view working correctly
- ‚úÖ Conflict detection function operational (detected 96-hour overlap correctly)
- ‚úÖ Database constraints preventing invalid schedules
- ‚úÖ Automatic equipment status updates via triggers

## üîÑ Next Implementation Steps

### 2. Backend API Development
**Status**: ‚è≥ **IN PROGRESS**

Need to implement REST API endpoints:

#### **Scheduling Endpoints**
```python
POST   /api/v1/schedules              # Create new equipment schedule
GET    /api/v1/schedules              # List schedules with filters
GET    /api/v1/schedules/{id}         # Get specific schedule
PUT    /api/v1/schedules/{id}         # Update schedule
DELETE /api/v1/schedules/{id}         # Cancel schedule

GET    /api/v1/schedules/conflicts/check  # Check for conflicts
GET    /api/v1/equipment/{id}/availability # Get availability
GET    /api/v1/equipment/{id}/schedules    # Get equipment schedules
```

#### **Business Logic Services**
- `SchedulingService` - Core scheduling business logic
- `ConflictDetectionService` - Advanced conflict checking
- `AvailabilityService` - Availability calculation and optimization

### 3. Frontend Components
